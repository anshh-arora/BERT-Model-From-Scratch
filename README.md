# BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

## Overview
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful language representation model developed by Google Research. It revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by introducing bidirectional context understanding through pretraining on large amounts of text data and fine-tuning on specific tasks.

This repository contains a BERT implementation from scratch using PyTorch. The model is trained for next-word prediction, a fundamental NLP task, where the goal is to predict the next word in a sequence given previous context.

## How BERT Works
BERT utilizes the Transformer architecture, which allows it to capture dependencies between words in both directions (bidirectional). This bidirectional context understanding is crucial for tasks requiring deep semantic understanding of language.

Key components of BERT:
- **Tokenization**: Converts input text into tokens and assigns each token an ID based on a pre-defined vocabulary.
- **Embedding Layer**: Maps token IDs to dense vectors (embeddings).
- **Transformer Encoder**: Processes embeddings through multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks to capture contextual information.
- **Pretraining and Fine-tuning**: BERT is first pretrained on large-scale corpora using masked language modeling and next sentence prediction tasks. It is then fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks with task-specific data and labels.

## Use Case: Next Word Prediction
In this implementation:
- **Tokenization**: Text is tokenized into IDs using a predefined vocabulary.
- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes an embedding layer, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for sequence modeling, and a linear layer for prediction.
- **Training**: The model is trained on sample sentences for next word prediction using cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.

## Code Structure
